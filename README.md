# COVID19-CASES-PREDICTION-INDIA
I made prediction of covid19 cases in India for all the three cases (Confirmed, Recovered and deceased cases) that give the future covid19 cases prediction using Supervised Machine Learning specifically Regression Algorithm. The prediction is done on both the current datasets and the previous datasets of covid19. Also represents the data in graphical representation using various python libraries.
